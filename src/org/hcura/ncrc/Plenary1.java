Engagement of Fas by Fas Ligand triggers a conformational change that allows Fas to interact with adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) via the cytoplasmic Death Domain, which recruits downstream signaling proteins to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Previous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is recruited into the DISC in cholangiocarcinoma cells, suggesting a novel role of CaM in Fas-mediated signaling. CaM antagonists induce apoptosis through a Fas-related mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma and other cancer cell lines possibly by inhibiting Fas-CaM interactions. The structural determinants of Fas-CaM interaction and the underlying molecular mechanisms of inhibition, however, are unknown. We employ NMR, biochemical, and biophysical techniques to elucidate these mechanisms. We have shown that CaM binds to the death domain of Fas (FasDD) with a novel 2:1 CaM:FasDD stoichiometry. The interactions between FasDD and CaM are endothermic and entropically driven, suggesting that hydrophobic contacts are critical for binding. Proteolytic digestion and NMR experiments facilitated the identification of the two minimal binding domains of Fas involved in CaM binding. Characterization of both peptides revealed the CaM-FasDD binding interface, including binding affinity, mode of binding, and thermodynamic properties. We provide the first structural evidence for Fas-CaM interactions and provide new insight into the molecular basis for a novel role of CaM in regulating Fas-mediated apoptosis. We believe these discoveries will facilitate the discovery of effective yet minimally toxic therapies for debilitating diseases such as cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p><b>Timothy Loh, Social Anthropology, Georgetown University, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B101</p><p>The Deaf Leading the Deaf (and the Deaf-Blind): An Ethnographic Account of Deaf Education at the Holy Land Institute for Deaf and Deaf-Blind Children, Jordan</b></p><p>This research paper explores the cultural construction of deafness and of deaf education at the Holy Land Institute for Deaf and Deaf-Blind Children (HLID) in Salt, Jordan, widely considered the leading institution in the Middle East and North Africa for deaf education and sign language research. Deafness is a topic rarely touched upon in both academia and the public sphere, particularly in the Arab region where there is a dearth of research on disability. Furthermore, what little research has been done sheds light on the host of problems faced by the disabled, especially with regard to education and employment. This ethnography aims to rectify that information gap and is based on fieldwork undertaken at the Institute during the summer of 2014, made possible by a generous grant from the Lisa J. Raines Fellowship, with data collected through participant observation, formal and informal interviews and analysis of cultural artifacts such as school newsletters and information pamphlets. My research revealed that the HLID conceives of its students as capable of being educated, employed and given leadership responsibilities, made manifest primarily in a self-regulatory system where older students are responsible for younger students. This system, while robust and generally effective, was not without criticism. Two other themes that emerged over the course of my research were the centrality of Jordanian Sign Language, which gave students a sense of agency, identity and pride, and the nuanced interreligious relations between Christians and Muslims resulting from the HLID being a Christian school in a Muslim country.</p><p> <b>Sarafina Nance, Astrophysics, University of Texas, Class of 2016 - Northwest Labs B103</p><p>Determining the Mass and Stellar Evolution Stage of Betelgeuse</b></p><p>We seek to constrain the mass and evolutionary state of Betelgeuse, a supergiant in the constellation Orion, to determine when it will explode as a supernova. We compile a suite of stellar evolution models (both rotating and non-rotating) of masses ranging from 15M to 25M to extract characteristic frequencies associated with convective regions. Detection of these frequencies could allow us to peer into the star. Extracted frequencies imply that if the rotational velocity equals the observed 5 km/sec, then we would expect to see “noise” at a timescale of several days slightly above the damping frequency. If, on the other hand, the star is in carbon burning, we expect low frequencies at a few days and high frequencies at several hours. We also constrain models with observed values of temperature, radius, luminosity, and rotational velocity. We find it is difficult to match all of the constraints with theoretical models. In particular, matching the observed rotational velocity of 5 km/sec seems to require that Betelgeuse is at the base, rather than the tip, of the red giant branch. This would imply that Betelgeuse is far from explosion, perhaps 100,000 years, but in a very special, brief phase of its evolution. Detection of predicted convective frequencies would help to confirm the evolutionary state.<h3>Session II</h3><p><b>Sean Kim, Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Class of 2016 - Northwest Labs Atrium</p><p>Increasing Engineered Cardiac Muscle Tissue Alignment in 2D</b></p><p>Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in most developed countries, yet currently there are no therapies to fully restore cardiac function after a large injury without transplantation. One potential mode of treatment lies in engineering cardiac tissue that can be patched into the site of injury. The contractile part of the heart – myocardium – consists of 2-dimensional laminar sheets of cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) wrapped around the heart. One of the key factors in developing such engineered cardiac tissue in vitro lies within creating a confluent layer of aligned cardiac muscle cells capable of synchronous contraction, for maximum contractile force. Previous studies in the field have shown that surfaces with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins micropatterned on them can stimulate cells to form aligned confluent cardiac sheets. However, the degree of cell alignment and the force produced by such engineered tissue can both be significantly increased. Two new patterns were developed; a pattern of 10µm wide lines of fibronectin with 4µm spacing, and a software-generated fiber-like pattern that mimics ECM structure in native chick myocardium. Statistical analysis showed that 10µm x 4µm pattern produced greater cell alignment compared to the 20µm x 20µm (control pattern), while the synthetic biomimetic pattern showed a statistically insignificant difference. The findings of this study show that the alignment of cardiac muscle cells in 2D can be improved by controlling the structure of the ECM protein.</p><p><b>Kiana Murphy, Literature, University of Wisconsin, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B101</p><p>Black Women Writing Bildungsroman Stories: Understanding Blackness, Womanhood, and Sex(uality) Through Fantasy, Magic, and Spirituality</b></p><p>To include intersectional identities, the ethnic Bildungsroman genre was developed to acknowledge the reality that little black and brown boys and girls are often barred from \"successful\" growth or integration into society. Although critics re-constructed the original genre to incorporate marginalized identities, they continued to ignore and invalidate marginalized writers’ roles as writers, creators, and storytellers. This project challenges and works to correct this practice using a mixed methodology that includes historiographical analysis, Black feminist criticism, and literary analysis. By critically analyzing a well-known text, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, and a work with little formal criticism, Bone Black by bell hooks, this project explores the how of Black women's storytelling. With Angelou’s text more focused on specific themes, scholars have consistently given her novel critical attention. However, since hooks uses a more unconventional approach for the narration of her coming of age story, I argue that this has influenced the lack of critical attention given by scholars for her novel. Although these two texts seem to be vastly different in their approaches to understanding the experiences of Black women growing up, I argue that unconventionality is seen in both and is crucial for their stories of girlhood. By focusing on the metaphysical, occurrences when both novels allude to dreams, fantasies, magic, or the spiritual, this paper proposes an extension of the ethnic Bildungsroman that recognizes unconventional stories like Bone Black, which deserves the critical acclaim as a captivating Bildungsroman of a young Black girl.</p><p><b>Jeffrey Wang, Biophysics, Harvard University, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B103</p><p>Modeling Force Generation in Cancerous Mammary Acini: Why Breast Cancer Might be as Much of an Exercise in Physics as in Biology</b></p><p>The rules and mechanical forces governing cell motility and interactions with the extracellular matrix of a tissue is often critical for understanding the mechanisms by which breast cancer is able to spread through the breast tissue and eventually metastasize. Ex vivo experimentation has demonstrated the the formation of long collagen fibers through collagen gels between the cancerous mammary acini responsible for milk production, providing a fiber scaffolding along which cancer cells can disorganize. We present a minimal mechanical model that serves as a potential explanation for the formation of these collagen fibers and the resultant motion. Our working hypothesis is that cancerous cells induce this fiber formation by pulling on the gel and taking advantage of the specific mechanical propreties of collagen. To model this system, we employ a new Eulerian, fixed grid simulation method to model the collagen as a nonlinear viscoelastic material subject to various forces coupled with a multi-agent model to describe individual cancer cells. We find that these phenomena can be explained by a series of relatively simple rules: cells pull collagen radially inwards and move towards the tension gradient of the collagen gel, while being exposed to standard adhesive and collision forces. Despite the overall simplicity of each individual agent, the emergent behavior of many cancerous cells taken as an ensemble can be complex, and we hope that our modeling can lead to future work on the biomechanics behind cancer and other biological functions.</p>"));
