Historically, programs have consisted of a justice component and a service component; however, beyond this, few national standards have been established. Diversion programs have taken the form of boot camps, community service projects, individual, group, and family counseling, case management services, and structured in-home interventions. Despite decades of experience, there is uncertainty in the research, criminal justice, and public safety communities about the most effective practices. We present the results of a rigorous evaluation of Reading for Life (RFL), an innovative diversion program for low-status juvenile offenders in a medium-sized Midwestern county. RFL allows juveniles to study works of literature in small reading groups led by trained volunteer mentors in an attempt to foster social awareness and character development through personal relationships and discussion. Participants (N=450) were randomly assigned to RFL treatment or a comparison program of community service. Using both ordinary least squares and Poisson regression models, we show that RFL generated large and statistically significant drops in future arrests. The program was particularly successful at reducing the chance of future serious offenses (prosecuted offenses fell 62%; prosecuted felonies 84% by OLS estimates) and reducing recidivism for groups with the highest propensity for future offenses. Our research offers insight into effective methods for diversion and a convincing argument for the scaling up of the program, an initiative already begun in surrounding counties.</p><p><b>Heather desJardins-Park, Chemistry, Harvard University, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B101</p><p>Designing an iron-based catalyst for enantioselective C-H bond functionalization</b></p><p>Hydrocarbons comprise the bulk of crude oil, and serve as the primary “feedstocks” of the chemical industry. However, due to the strength of carbon-hydrogen (C—H) bonds, hydrocarbons are relatively inert. The ability to chemically functionalize C—H bonds catalytically and on an industrial scale could allow the direct conversion of hydrocarbons into more reactive molecules of increased functionality and value. Previous work has led to the synthesis of an iron-based organometallic complex that can catalyze such reactions. However, this catalyst cannot influence the reactions’ stereochemical outcomes. Being able to exert selectivity over product chirality could have important implications for applications of the catalyst, particularly for biologically relevant uses (e.g., drug synthesis), where stereochemistry is critical. This project aims to design and synthesize an iron-based organometallic catalyst capable of controlling the stereochemistry of the C—H functionalization reaction. We have synthesized a chiral ligand, in an attempt to partially occlude the catalyst’s reactive site and thus influence the substrate’s orientation upon binding to the catalyst. We hope to show that the chiral cleft created by the ligand will influence the stereochemistry of the products formed. By introducing chiral moieties at different locations on the catalyst, we have been able to probe how the catalyst may influence the reaction, and we hope to use this knowledge to tune the catalyst’s enantioselectivity. Ultimately, we hope that this catalyst will see applications in the chemical industry, presenting a novel method to introduce both chirality and reactivity into the simplest chemical “feedstocks.”</p><p><b>Gabrielle Zuniga, Biology, University of Texas, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B103</p><p>The Sigma-2 Receptor is a Potential Therapeutic Target of Alzheimer’s Disease</b></p><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, yet the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, share a common underlying dysfunction in endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial protein regulation that leads to patterned neurodegeneration and death. Specific to AD, β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide accumulates in senile plaques within the brain due to abnormal processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Here we explored whether a new target, the sigma-2 receptor (Sig2R), can provide a neuroprotective influence in the face of APP dysregulation. In cancer cells, Sig2R has a well-known role in regulating apoptosis but its role in AD remains unstudied. We developed a C. elegans model system with pan-neuronal expression of an extra copy of human APP that displays progressive, age-dependent degeneration of specific cholinergic neurons. We showed that two loss-of-function Sig2R alleles reduce neurodegeneration in AD animals to non-AD control levels. Additionally, GFP-labeled ventral cord neurons accumulated mcherry-tagged human APP in the AD model with wild-type Sig2R. However, a loss-of-function Sig2R allele reduced mcherry signal relative to GFP expression. Next we tested whether pharmacological manipulation of Sig2R could reduce AD-related neurodegeneration. A modular biology oriented synthetic approach was used to synthesize novel sigma receptor ligands to a range of novel, druglike scaffolds. A preliminary screen found one Sig1R/Sig2R ligand that reduced neurodegeneration in a Sig2R-dependent manner. Together, these data demonstrate that Sig2R-targeted ligands can reduce age-dependent neurodegeneration in this model system and suggesting that Sig2R is a viable therapeutic target for AD.<h3>Session IV</h3><p><b>Rashmi Borah, Bioethics, Ohio State University, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs Atrium</p><p>Prophylactic Organ Removal as a Means of Cancer Prevention: A Programmatic Analysis of Ethical Considerations</b></p><p>Prophylactic organ removal refers to the surgical removal of a healthy organ, devoid of any indication of tumor growth at the time of removal, in hopes of preventing the potential onset of tumor growth. Prophylactic organ removal has been used as a treatment option for patients presenting with mutations in the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene. Current literature focused on evaluating the efficacy of the practice has focused almost exclusively on the physiological arguments for or against the practice, with a limited focus on impact of the practice from a non-physiological, patient-centered perspective. This project presents a programmatic analysis of non-physiological ethical considerations relevant to this procedure, in the hopes that these considerations prepare the foundation for a more inclusive risk-benefit analysis. The research methodology focuses on the explication and critical discussion of three particular topics: 1) therapeutic applications of prophylactic organ removal, particularly at the psychological level, 2) a feminist perspective which acknowledges that, with women being the majority of patients undergoing this practice in this context, the impact of this practice on a woman’s conception of herself and society’s conception of femininity is crucial, and 3) whether the traditional arguments describing, supporting, or challenging the working definition of autonomy apply for this procedure, and whether alternate considerations about the execution of autonomy are relevant to this particular procedure. A systematic explication of these three topics and their application to prophylactic organ removal is necessary in determining the ethical status of the procedure on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><b>David Mackanic, Chemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B101</p><p>Analysis of Selective ssDNA Release from Photothermally Active Hollow Gold Nanospheres using Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering</b></p><p>Gene therapy is a rapidly developing DNA-based therapy that promises to provide treatment for oncological and inflammatory diseases. The creation of an effective DNA delivery vector is necessary for effective implementation of gene therapy. The photothermal release of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) from the surface of gold nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes is a promising mode of delivering DNA for gene-therapy applications. Here, we demonstrate the first targeted photothermal release of ssDNA from hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs). The HGNs used demonstrate a tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) while maintaining size consistency. It was shown that HGN 760 and HGN 670 release significant amounts of ssDNA when excited via 785 nm and 640 nm lasers respectively. When excited with a wavelength far from the LSPR of the particles, the ssDNA release is negligible. This study also presents the first use of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to analyze the amount of ssDNA released from the surface of gold nanoparticles. As opposed to traditional fluorescence measurements, this SERS based approach provides quantitatively robust data for analysis of ssDNA release and lays a strong foundation for future studies exploiting plasmonically induced ssDNA release. Furthermore, the HGN-based ssDNA system has potential to enable multi-step gene therapy treatments by utilizing different LSPR frequencies that deliver different ssDNA payloads. The DNA system demonstrated here can be applied to in-vitro studies and is expected to successfully release therapeutic DNA for treatment of disease.</p><p><b>Layla Quran, Social Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Class of 2015 - Northwest Labs B103</p><p>Palestinian artists of Israel and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement</b></p><p> Inspired from the anti-apartheid boycott movement in South Africa, the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement was launched and endorsed in 2005 by a majority of Palestinian civil society unions, organizations and political parties. The BDS movement has three demands: equal treatment for Palestinian citizens of Israel, an end to the occupation of Gaza, the West bank, and East Jerusalem, and the right of return for all Palestinian refugees. The movement is divided into an academic, economic, and cultural boycott campaign, though my research focuses on the call for the cultural boycott and the reactions of Palestinian artists living in Israel. Just as South African artists participated in the anti-apartheid boycott movement in the 1980s, I am interested in how Palestinian citizens of Israel are responding to the call for the cultural boycott of Israel today. My research question is ‘How do Palestinian artists in Israel respond to the call for a cultural boycott through their art and actions? Palestinians living in Israel, as tax-paying citizens, have the option of receiving funds from the Israeli state or Israeli cultural institutions. They also may collaborate with Israeli artists, and attend concerts by international artists in Israel. The BDS movement has specific guidelines for Palestinian citizens of Israel to follow, and through several interviews, I conclude that although most artists support the goals of the boycott movement, many artists adhere to the cultural boycott guidelines only on a case-by-case basis. Most do not accept funding from the Israeli government if it is conditional, and may work with Israeli artists, but only if the individual they collaborate with speaks for Palestinian rights. There is also still no consensus among Palestinian artists on if international artists, ranging from the Rolling Stones to Madonna, should be allowed to perform in Israel. This research can be used to understand the support and critique of the BDS movement as the main non-violent resistance movement for Palestinians, the interactions Palestinian citizens of Israel have with the Israeli state and other artists, and, the role of the artist in daily politics."));
